SandCastle is an ActionScript library built by The Yellow Thorn (www.theyellowthorn.com) on the Away3D framework to support higher-quality 16-bit terrain generation and manipulation.  It accompanies the SandCastle program (www.theyellowthorn.com/sandcastle/get) which is designed to create and preview 3D worlds for Flash and AIR projects.
